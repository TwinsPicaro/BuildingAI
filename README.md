# Weather predictions

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Weather prediction using historical data involves collecting and analyzing various information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, pression, etc.
The goal is to predict specific weather attributes (e.g., temperature, rainfall) for future time.


## Background

The idea of weather prediction based on historical data aims to address several challenges related to forecasting future weather conditions, allowing measures to keep the safety.
Weather prediction is a daily necessity. Accurate forecasts are fundamental for governments and emergency services.
The weather affects everyone and everything, making accurate predictions crucial for  planning and safety.
I just want to learn about machine learning and its applications.

* PROBLEM 1: Finding a dataset of historical data about weather and the conditions
* PROBLEM 2: Finding how to fight the Uncertainity
* PROBLEM 3: Count the differences during time in the region
* PROBLEM 4: Limit the prediction to the next 3 days


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The Solution is needed by everyone. The citizens needs it for their daily routine. The government needs it to send emergency alerts in case of risky situations. 
The Emergency Services needs it to prepare and respond to natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, wildfires, as closing roads and so on.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
It's limited as it can't do an absolute prediction, it relies on data accuracy, also It can't do long predictions and has to fight against uncertainity.
The information should be taken as a pinch of salt and they should be communicated with all the needed information as it has a huge impact on society. 

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 

Integrating real-time data streams from weather stations, satellites, IoT devices, and other sources could enhance the project's capabilities.
Incorporating geospatial data and analysis techniques to account for spatial variability in weather patterns.
Collaborating with meteorologists, climatologists, and domain experts to better understand weather dynamics and refine the models.
